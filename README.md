GAN is a neural network that learns to create synthetic data similar to known input data. Currently, researchers have been able to use GANs to synthesize a series of photos from bedrooms to album covers, and GANs have also shown extraordinary ability to reflect higher-level semantic logic.

These examples are very complicated, but it is not difficult to build a GAN that can generate simple images. 
# In this tutorial, we will learn to build a GAN that analyzes handwritten digital images and learn from scratch how to make it learn to generate new images. In simple words, it is to teach neural networks how to write.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.
